# üêü Fishtank.nvim

A little friend to keep you company.

## üê† Video Demo

The fish will appear automatically after a given amount of time, and disappear
whenever you do something. Or if you choose to show it manually, it will stay
with you until manually dismissed.

## üåä Installation, Usage, and Configuration

Lazy.nvim config:

```lua
{
    'nullromo/fishtank.nvim',
    opts = {}, -- specify options here
    config = function(_, opts)
        local fishtank = require('fishtank')
        fishtank.setup(opts)
    end,
}
```

### User Command

There is one user command, `:Fishtank`. It accepts the following arguments:

- `start`, `on`, `open`, or `show` : shows the fishtank manually.
- `stop`, `off`, `close`, or `hide` : hides the fishtank manually.
- `toggle` : shows the fishtank if it is hidden; otherwise hides it.

### Default Options

```lua
-- default options if unspecified by user
M.defaultOptions = {
    -- options for controlling the behavior of the screensaver
    screensaver = {
        -- whether or not the screensaver comes on at all
        enabled = true,
        -- amount of idle time before the screensaver comes on
        timeout = 60 * 1000 * 10, -- 10 minutes
    },
    -- sprite customization
    sprite = {
        left = '<><', -- fish moving to the left
        right = '><>', -- fish moving to the right
        color = '#FFFFFF', -- color of the fish
    },
}
```

### Inspiration

This plugin was inspired by a program I wrote on a
[TI-84 Plus Silver Edition graphing calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-84_Plus_series)
in high school.

Also, VSCode users
[have this kind of thing](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonybaloney.vscode-pets),
so why can't we have it too? üòÑ

Partly inspired by [drop.nvim](https://github.com/folke/drop.nvim).
